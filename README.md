# VAProxy.FOVMod

I to increase FOV, O to decrease. (Increments are 5)

Your FOV is (thankfully) saved! Alt+F4's and resets preserve your FOV.

Maybe I'll add a feature to change your keybinds (i'll probably just yoink some code from taira)

(I am aware that healing zooms your camera in to the default FOV, the method for changing your FOV is super scuffed)
